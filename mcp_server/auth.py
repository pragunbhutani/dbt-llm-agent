"""Lightweight authentication extraction for the standalone MCP server.

We no longer have direct access to Django's database.  Instead of validating JWTs
locally, we treat them as opaque bearer tokens and forward them to the Django
backend (which will perform the real validation/authorisation).  This keeps the
MCP service completely stateless.
